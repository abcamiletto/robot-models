# BrainCo

BrainCo is a rigid articulated model of the BrainCo Revo 2 robotic hand using
the official MuJoCo XML and STL assets.

## Setup

BrainCo downloads from the public
[`abcamiletto/robot-models`](https://huggingface.co/abcamiletto/robot-models)
Hugging Face repository on first use. To prefetch the assets:

```bash
robot-models download brainco
```

When passed manually, `model_path` should contain `left.xml`, `right.xml`, and
`meshes/{left,right}/*.STL`.

The original BrainCo Revo 2 description license is included with the hosted assets.

## Usage

```python
from robot_models.brainco.numpy import BrainCoHand

hand = BrainCoHand(side="right")
```

## Notes

The model exposes the six active Revo 2 joints for each hand: thumb metacarpal,
thumb proximal, and the proximal joints for index, middle, ring, and pinky.
Passive distal joints are included in the skeleton and meshes.
